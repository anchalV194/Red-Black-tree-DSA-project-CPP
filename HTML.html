        <p class="description">
            A <strong>Red-Black Tree</strong> is a type of self-balancing binary search tree where each node is colored either red or black. 
            It ensures that the tree remains balanced after insertions or deletions. Key properties of the Red-Black Tree include:
        </p>
        <ul class="description-list">
            <li>Each node is either red or black.</li>
            <li>The root is always black.</li>
            <li>Red nodes cannot have red children (no two consecutive red nodes).</li>
            <li>Every path from the root to a leaf has the same number of black nodes, ensuring balance.</li>
            <li>Insertion and deletion operations are followed by rotations and recoloring to maintain tree properties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="description">
            This visualization allows you to insert values into the tree, observe how it maintains balance, and understand the inner workings of a Red-Black Tree. Red nodes are shown in red, and black nodes in black.
