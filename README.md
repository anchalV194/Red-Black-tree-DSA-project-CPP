In 1972, Rudolf Bayer invented a data structure that was a special order-4 case of a B-tree.  These trees maintained all paths from root to leaf with the same number of nodes, creating  perfectly balanced trees. However, they were not binary search trees. Bayer called them a  "symmetric binary B-tree" in his paper .
